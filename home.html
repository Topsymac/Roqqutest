        <h2> What is Bitcoin? </h2>
        <p> Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias <i>Satoshi Nakamoto</i>. <br>
            Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, <q>no banks! </q><br>
            But much of the hype is about getting rich by trading it. The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.<br>
            Bitcoins can be used to buy merchandise anonymously.<br>
             In addition, international payments are easy and cheap because bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation. <br>
             Small businesses may like them because there are no credit card fees. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they’ll go up in value.<br>
             You can buy Bitcoin using your local currency</p>
